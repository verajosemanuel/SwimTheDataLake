Started my career long time ago administering data architectures based on SQL Server and Oracle. Did some CRUD programming and database management applications with ASP and PHP.
Designing data architectures and modeling relational databases for complex applications lead to Certifications on Business Intelligence with Oracle BI an Microsoft BI.

Early on my path got to know Linux and Open Source Community, and feeling very passionate about it, started to work with MySql Clusters (Percona), PostgreSql Server on Debian, using Pentaho Kettle as ETL and Eclipse BIRT as reporting tool, among many others, for my analytical work. From these days on, I can't stand with windows and I always prefer Bash and Zsh for my basic daily work. There's a lot of tools to do Data Science without getting out from the command line.

But the milestone in my career was the R language. I remember my first encounter with this language. I remember the goose bumps and the soft exclamation (_"Oh my..."_) that suddenly came out of my mouth the day I fired Rstudio and issued a simple "table" command with some data I was analyzing. Love at first sight.

Became some time ago Chief Data Officer for a big international Spanish Start-up for 5 years, got in touch with Spark, Cassandra and MongoDB, and continued my path with Python (Pandas) skills, Docker Containers.... and a Master's Degree on Data Science. Now I'm working as a Senior Data Scientist for a Financial Company.

My main tasks are focused on data science, data analysis, natural language processing, AI assisted decision Support, predictive modeling and Machine Learning applied to Management platforms for distressed assets and Financial data. Dashboard design, geographical mapping & data visualization. Research & Development of new strategies on processing huge amounts of data and discovering data insights delivering a broad range of products from reporting tools with Rmarkdown, Shiny and Tableau, to Natural Language Processing on fast and automatic document classification for legal support.

Love to learn new things to make my work faster, cleaner and prettier.
