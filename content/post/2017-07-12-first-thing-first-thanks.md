First thing first

Question of etiquette, when starting a blog like this, entirely focused on Data Science with R, is to acknowledge all the people and teams that made possible that I'm writing this today.

People from CRAN, Rstudio and R consortium, for pushing forward the best language in the world for data analytics. A language I love from the first day.
HUGO team for making such an easy and quick site builder for static pages, and last but not least, Yihui Xie for Blogdown, an awesome R package for blogging from Rstudio.

Thanks all!!!
