Finally, my package was ready for submission on CRAN and now it's published!

Not a great piece of work, just a place to gather a bunch of functions that I was unable to find anywhere else because are related to spanish data.

Just one function right now, translating numerical quantities spelled in spanish to their integer counterparts.
More functions in the coming months, related to Spanish Cadastral API, data cleaning, and such...

Please feel free to suggest any function you'd need for spanish specific data.
